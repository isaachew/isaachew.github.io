        <h1>Isaac Hew</h1>

        <p>I am Isaac Hew. I like maths and computer programming, especially JavaScript and C++.</p>
        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>I am interested in maths, as well as programming. I have participated in a few maths and competitive programming competitions.</p>
        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <h2>Path Editor</h2>

        <h2>Mandelbrot</h2>
        <p>
            On <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmnMYrpcxF6WHzNxOZ1Hi2Q">my YouTube Account</a>, I have published a few zooms into the Mandelbrot Set.
            I have made a program which allows me to zoom into the Mandelbrot Set. I have also implemented a few algorithms, including a rendering algorithm based on perturbation theory and Newton-Raphson Zooming.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have created a <a href="/mandelbrot-explorer">program</a> that renders the Mandelbrot Set. The program uses Web Workers to quickly render the Mandelbrot Set.
            Its features include:
            <ul>
                <li>Custom location and resolution</li>
                <li>Custom colour palette</li>
                <li>Built-in video renderer</li>
            </ul>
            There are also several features that will be implemented soon.
        </p>
