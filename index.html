        <h2>Mandelbrot</h2>
        <p>
            On <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmnMYrpcxF6WHzNxOZ1Hi2Q">my YouTube Account</a>, I have published a few zooms into the Mandelbrot Set.
            I have made a program which allows me to zoom into the Mandelbrot Set. I have also implemented a few algorithms, including an algorithm based on perturbation theory and Newton-Raphson Zooming.
            To create a zoom video, I first need to find the location.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have created a program that renders the Mandelbrot Set. The program uses C++ compiled to WebAssembly and JavaScript using Emscripten. You can view the program <a href="/mandelbrot-explorer">here</a>.
